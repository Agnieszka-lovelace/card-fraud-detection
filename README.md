# card-fraud-detection

So the purpose of this project is to determine the tampering of pan card using computer vision. 

And this project will help different organizations into detecting whether the ID that is the pan card provided to them by their employees is original or not. 

I will calculate the structural similarities between the original PAN card and the pan card uploaded by the user.
