# card-fraud-detection

So the purpose of this project is to determine the tampering of ID card using computer vision. 

And this project will help different organizations into detecting whether the ID that is the ID card provided to them by their employees is original or not. 

I will calculate the structural similarities between the original ID card and the ID card uploaded by the user.
